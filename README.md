Welcome to my 2D Game Engine! This game engine is still under development. The long term goal is to create different games by using different interfaces. Aside there will be an artificial intelligence which learns how to play chess (therefore i started implementing a chess game) against human players or another AI. Before starting with AI this will be a coding playground. first of all this will be a independent 2D game engine with an different interfaces (dll, python, lua) and an implemented chess game.
  
First setup with chess figures and a gaming scenario

Next Steps:
- finishing chess implementation
- adding further basic engine components/systems (fonts, drawing, collision, game control, hud, etc.)
- creating api's
- starting AI
